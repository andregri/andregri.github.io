# Who I am

I am a non-stop learner looking for constant innovation.
I canâ€™t stand still, I am always looking for new challenges.
I am a _techaholic_, interested in new and disruptive technologies such as p2p
networking, blockchains, cloud computing, and devops.

I like develop in C++, Go and Python.

Avid book reader and podcast listener.
Open source lover and defender. Best way to reach me? Github.

# Andrea Grillo
I am a passionate developer based in Genoa, where I live, surf and windsurf.

Welcome to my website!

## Work
I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.kiratech.it/"><span style="font-weight:700;margin-right:3px;color:#FF7F50">Kiratech</span><img alt="kiratech logo" src="/assets/images/work-logo.jpg"/></a> as a cloud native engineer, designing architectures for cloud environments, provisioning infrastructure as code, and developing on kubernetes clusters. In other words, I'm working with Terraform, Kubernetes, Go and Python.

## Side projects
Over the last few years, I published many repositories on cloud and kubernetes development.

Besides these side projects, I blog about Terraform, Kubernetes, Go and Python, cloud development.

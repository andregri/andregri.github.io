### Hello! I'm
# Andrea Grillo

I am an engineer with a background in telecommunications, digital signal
processing, and remote sensing image analysis.

My interests span from backend, cloud, DevOps to remote sensing, deep learning.

My favorite tools are Linux, Python, Golang, git and GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes
and AWS. Of course, I am am open-source lover and defender.

Outside of work, I often take part to Hackathons. Rarely I do CTFs to practice
security skills.

I am an avid podcast listener and a chess player.
You can challenge me at [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/robogri) or 
at [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/@/andregri). I prefer longer time limits
per move rather than bullet chess.
